% [X,Y0,X0,lx,Z] = lll(Y,W,d,L[,kZ,nl])
% LLL algorithm for fast Laplacian Eigenmaps
%
% This computes a fast, approximate Laplacian Eigenmaps embedding for a
% high-dimensional dataset using the Locally Linear Landmarks (LLL) algorithm.
% LLL also provides an out-of-sample mapping, see lllmap.m.
%
% For details about how to select the landmarks (indices lx) and construct the
% reconstruction weights (matrix Z), see functions lmarks.m and lweights.m,
% respectively, inside lll.m. At present we use simple but effective choices
% in these functions: random landmarks and LLE-style weights, respectively.
%
% It should be easy to modify lll.m to solve spectral problems other than
% Laplacian Eigenmaps, say LLE, by constructing the relevant graph Laplacian
% and the matrices A and B below.
%
% In:
%   Y: NxD matrix of N row D-dimensional vectors.
%   W: NxN affinity matrix (usually sparse).
%   d: dimension of the latent space.
%   L: number of landmarks.
%   kZ: number of landmarks each data point uses. Default: d+1.
%   nl: normalised (1) or unnormalised (0) Laplacian. Default: 0.
% Out:
%   X: N x d matrix of N row d-dimensional vectors, the projections of Y.
%   Y0: LxD matrix of L row D-dimensional vectors, the landmarks.
%   X0: L x d matrix of L row d-dimensional vectors, the landmark projections.
%   lx: 1xL list of the indices of the landmarks in Y: Y0=Y(lx,:), X0=X(lx,:).
%   Z: LxN matrix of reconstruction weights.
%
% Any non-mandatory argument can be given the value [] to force it to take
% its default value.

% The solution through the generalized eigenvalue problem:

[U,E] = eigs(A,B,d+1,'sm',opts); E = diag(E); [~,ind] = sort(E);

% $$$ BB = sqrtm(full(B)); C = (BB\A)/BB; C = (C+C')/2;
% $$$ [U,E] = eig(C); E = diag(E); [~,ind] = sort(E); U = U(:,ind(2:d+1));
